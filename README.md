# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is **Rodion**
### I am a head of development, DS and python developer.

#### Status: **open to work**

I have a passion for improving business processes through analysis and modeling. With unquenchable enthusiasm I get into the essence of an issue and enjoy the process of solving it. I easily infect others with ideas and motivate them to achieve their goal. In my free time I improve my skills, play drums in a rock band once or twice a week, sometimes play beach volleyball with my wife at weekends.
 
Skills: Python / Unittest / Airflow / Flask / SQL / Forcasting / AB-tests
