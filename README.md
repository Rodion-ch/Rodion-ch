# Hi there 👋, my name is **Rodion**
### I am a head of development, DS and python backend developer.

I have a passion for improving business processes through analysis and modeling. With unquenchable enthusiasm I get into the essence of an issue and enjoy the process of solving it. I easily infect others with ideas and motivate them to achieve their goal. In my free time I improve my skills, play drums in a rock band, sometimes play beach volleyball at weekends.
 
Skills: Python / Unittest / Airflow / FastAPI / AsyncIO / Docker / SQL / Forcasting / AB-tests
