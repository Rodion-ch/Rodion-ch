I have a passion for improving business processes through analysis and modeling, with unquenchable enthusiasm I get to the bottom of the issue and enjoy it.
I easily infect others with ideas and motivate to achieve the goal.
In my free time I am engaged in advanced training, once or twice a week I play drums in a rock band, sometimes on weekends I play beach volleyball with my wife.

Skills: Python / Unittest / Airflow / Flask / SQL / Forcasting / AB-tests
